# Music-Tech-Prototype-Website

A prototype website I created for a high school music technology class. This personal project was an experimental endeavor to practice and apply concepts learned in my digital solutions classes on Python web development. Although it was never completed and not part of any formal assessment, it served me as a valuable learning experience.
